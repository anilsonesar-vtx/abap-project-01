This document provides guidelines and best practices for using GitHub Copilot in this repository.

## General Guidelines

- **Contextual Prompts**: Always provide Copilot with sufficient context to generate accurate and helpful suggestions. Include relevant code snippets, comments, and documentation.
- **Review and Edit**: Always review the code suggestions provided by Copilot. Make necessary edits to ensure the code meets your project's standards and requirements.
- **Security**: Be cautious of potential security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Review the code for any security risks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities.
- **Performance**: Ensure the generated code is optimized for performance. Avoid using inefficient algorithms and practices that may degrade the performance of your application.
- **Code Style**: Follow the coding style and conventions established in your project. Edit the generated code to match the style guidelines, including naming conventions, indentation, and documentation.
